# GREEN Phase Results - Testing With Skill

## Test Comparison: RED vs GREEN

### Test 1: Time Pressure (15-minute deadline)

| Aspect | RED (without skill) | GREEN (with skill) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Citation-manager | Used but considered skipping | Used systematically as step 1 |
| Categories checked | 4 out of 9 | All 9 categories |
| Output format | Free-form narrative | Structured table format |
| Rationalization | "Focused on most relevant" | Recognized pressure, resisted |
| Time to complete | ~4 min (rushed) | ~8 min (systematic) |
| Issues found | 5 major violations | All violations + categorized |

**Key Quote from GREEN:**
> "I felt pressure, but I resisted it. The skill explicitly calls out these rationalizations: 'Time pressure' → Systematic evaluation takes 5-10 minutes, prevents weeks of rework"

### Test 2: MVP Label Bias

| Aspect | RED (without skill) | GREEN (with skill) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Categories checked | MVP principles only | All 9 categories |
| Label influence | Strong - "MVP" = only check MVP | Recognized as WARNING SIGN |
| Self-correction | None | Caught and corrected rationalization |
| Completeness | Partial (MVP-focused) | Complete (all principles) |
| Data model check | Skipped | Checked and found missing |
| Safety principles | Skipped | Checked and found violations |

**Key Quote from GREEN:**
> "The 'MVP' label triggered a mental shortcut to focus on MVP principles only. The skill is designed to catch exactly this behavior... 'MVP' on a document is not permission to skip architectural rigor - it's a WARNING SIGN"

## Compliance Improvements

### What Skill Enforced Successfully

1. **Mandatory jact first step**
   - Both agents ran it before evaluation
   - Recognized as non-negotiable

2. **Systematic category coverage**
   - All 9 categories checked
   - "➖ Not mentioned" used appropriately vs. skipping

3. **Structured output format**
   - Table with Status column
   - Critical issues with line numbers
   - Verdict with checkboxes

4. **Rationalization resistance**
   - Agents noticed pressure to cut corners
   - Explicitly cited skill rules to resist

5. **Document type awareness**
   - MVP label recognized as high-risk signal
   - Design docs evaluated for modularity explicitly

## New Observations

### Agent Self-Awareness
Both agents showed meta-cognition:
- "I felt pressure to skip steps"
- "Initially tempted to focus only on MVP principles"
- "The skill prevented this shortcut"

This suggests the skill is working as intended - making rationalizations explicit and resistible.

### Time Investment Validation
- GREEN agent: 8 minutes for complete evaluation
- Found 5+ additional violations missed in RED's 4-minute rushed review
- Validates skill claim: "5-10 minutes prevents weeks of rework"

## Potential Loopholes (for REFACTOR)

### Loophole 1: "Citation-manager found nothing, so I can skip extraction context"
**Observation:** Both tests had broken links, so jact returned 0 results.
**Risk:** Agent might skip the step entirely if links appear broken.
**Need to plug:** Make extraction mandatory regardless of results; null results still inform evaluation.

### Loophole 2: "Document has no detail on X, so I mark it compliant"
**Not observed yet, but potential:** Agent might interpret "not mentioned" as "compliant" rather than "gap to address."
**May need to clarify:** "➖ Not mentioned" = potential gap, should recommend adding detail.

### Loophole 3: TodoWrite overhead might be skipped
**Not tested yet:** Skill requires TodoWrite for checklist items.
**Risk:** Agent might skip TodoWrite to "save time."
**Status:** Need to add explicit requirement.

## Verdict on GREEN Phase

### ✅ SKILL WORKING AS DESIGNED

The skill successfully:
- Enforces systematic evaluation (all categories)
- Requires jact first
- Provides structured output format
- Makes rationalizations explicit and resistible
- Transforms document labels into warning signs vs. excuses

**Next step:** REFACTOR phase to plug any identified loopholes.
